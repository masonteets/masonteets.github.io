        <h1>Did you know Pepsi almost had to give a dude a fighter jet?</h1>
      <h3>Have you ever heard of the "Pepsi Harrier Jet" case? In 1995, Pepsi ran a promotional campaign called "Pepsi Points," where customers could accumulate points by purchasing Pepsi products and then redeem those points for various merchandise. One of the featured items in the promotional catalog was a Harrier jet, a high-performance military aircraft.
        In the commercial promoting the campaign, a teenager named John Leonard ordered the Harrier jet using Pepsi Points and sent a check for $700,008.50, which he believed covered the required points and taxes. However, the actual cost of the Harrier jet was significantly higher, around $23 million.
        Pepsi, naturally, did not intend to fulfill the Harrier jet order. They argued that the commercial was intended to be humorous and unrealistic, and that no reasonable person would expect to receive a military jet in exchange for Pepsi Points. Pepsi offered Leonard an alternative compensation of $5,000 worth of Pepsi Points, which he declined.
        The case ended up in court, and the judge ruled in favor of Pepsi, stating that the commercial was obviously meant to be taken as a joke and that no reasonable person would interpret it as a serious offer. The judge dismissed Leonard's lawsuit.</h3>
